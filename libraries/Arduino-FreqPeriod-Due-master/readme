FreqPeriod library for Arduino Due.

I use this primarily to measure IR carrier frequency. As far as I can tell it's accurate enough.

The only real concern I have right now is having to use attachInterrupt. I know I could create an interrupt for whatever PIO I choose (and it would make things even more accurate), but then if you wanted to use that PIO for another library you'd instantly have a conflict. Suggestions are more than welcome to improve the library.

It is based loosely on the FreqPeriod library from:
FreqPeriod Library for Frequency Measurement.
